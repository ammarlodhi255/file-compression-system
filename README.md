# FileCompression-Project-DS
What is this project about?

This project is about Building an application for Text File Compression using Huffman Encoding Given a a text file as an input, 
this app will compress the file and then saving the file with reduced size. You can also decompress the file using this app into 
its original form. This app also has some additional features such as: Given a string of alphabetic characters, you can compress 
the size of its bit sequence to obtain a binary sequence that has size significantly less than the original, this new sequence 
can be sent through a network or saved in file so that it can be decompressed whenever required.

How it will run, how it will work?

In order to run the application, first step is to download all the project files in this branch and then put them in an appropriate folder.
We have provided an executable jar file inside the folder named "Executable file" in which you will find a jar file named "Encodor.jar" and "EncoderGUI.jar".
You can click on any one of these to execute the application. (There is also an alternative way to execute the project, if you can not open the jar file, you can 
open the project in any IDE and execute the main method inside the class "EncoderGUI").
Upon opening the application you will be given an option to browse a file and select it. After you have selected your file, choose the location where you want to 
save the compressed file. After you have done all these steps you can hit the "Compress" Button to compress your file. For further detailed instructions on how the 
project works, you can refer to the following video:
